By combining collaborative filtering with natural language processing (NLP), it ensures each user receives tailored news content that evolves with their interests.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Use **collaborative filtering** to generate **personalized news article recommendations**
- Provide an intuitive, responsive **JavaFX user interface**
- Enable users to **browse**, **rate**, and **interact** with news articles
- Integrate with **external news APIs** to fetch live content
- Maintain user and article data with **MySQL database**


## ✨ Features
